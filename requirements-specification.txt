Requirements Specification: Daily Quote Generator with Mood Analysis
1. Project Overview
The Daily Quote Generator with Mood Analysis is a web application that provides users with inspirational quotes, analyzes the emotional tone of each quote, and presents them visually with mood-appropriate styling. The application will dynamically generate color schemes based on sentiment analysis of quote text, creating an intuitive visual representation of the quote's emotional content.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Quote Management

The system shall retrieve random quotes from an external API.
The system shall display a new quote each day.
The system shall allow users to manually refresh and receive a new quote.
The system shall store the daily quote to prevent unnecessary API calls.
The system shall maintain a history of previously displayed quotes.
The system shall allow users to save quotes to a favorites collection.

2.2 Sentiment Analysis

The system shall analyze each quote to determine its emotional tone.
The system shall categorize quotes into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral).
The system shall calculate a sentiment intensity score for each quote.
The system shall identify key positive and negative words in each quote.
The system shall generate a visual representation of the quote's mood.

2.3 Visualization

The system shall generate a color scheme based on sentiment analysis results.
The system shall display quotes with background colors/gradients that reflect the quote's mood.
The system shall include a visual indicator of the quote's sentiment score.
The system shall provide smooth transitions when changing between quotes.
The system shall adapt the text color to ensure readability against dynamic backgrounds.

2.4 User Interaction

The system shall provide a button to manually request a new quote.
The system shall allow users to share quotes on social media platforms.
The system shall allow users to toggle between favorite quotes and daily quotes.
The system shall provide a subtle animation when a new quote is loaded.
The system shall allow users to filter quotes by sentiment category if desired.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Performance Requirements

The application shall load initially within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections.
The system shall retrieve new quotes and perform sentiment analysis within 1 second.
The application shall function smoothly on devices with limited processing power.
The application shall minimize API calls by implementing appropriate caching strategies.

3.2 Usability Requirements

The user interface shall be intuitive and require no instructions for basic functionality.
The application shall be accessible to users with visual impairments (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance).
The application shall provide clear visual feedback for all user interactions.
The text shall be legible at various screen sizes with a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1.
The application shall provide helpful error messages if quote retrieval fails.

3.3 Reliability Requirements

The application shall function properly without internet connection by using cached quotes.
The system shall gracefully handle API failures with appropriate fallback mechanisms.
The application shall not lose user's favorites if the browser is closed or refreshed.

3.4 Compatibility Requirements

The application shall function correctly on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
The application shall be responsive and fully functional on mobile devices (iOS and Android).
The application shall adapt to different screen sizes from 320px to 2560px width.

4. Technical Requirements
4.1 Development Environment

The application shall be developed using TypeScript for type safety.
The application shall use React for component-based architecture.
The application shall use a modern bundler (e.g., Webpack, Vite) for asset management.
The application shall be structured following React best practices for maintainability.

4.2 External Dependencies

The application shall use a public quote API (e.g., Quotable, ZenQuotes).
The application shall use a sentiment analysis library (e.g., sentiment.js).
The application shall use a styling solution (Styled Components or Tailwind CSS).
The application shall use standard browser APIs for storage and sharing.

4.3 State Management

The application shall implement appropriate state management using React hooks.
The application shall persist user preferences and favorites using browser localStorage.
The application shall handle asynchronous operations with proper loading and error states.

5. User Interface Requirements
5.1 Layout

The application shall have a clean, minimalist interface centered around the quote display.
The quote card shall be the focal point of the interface.
Navigation elements shall be unobtrusive but easily accessible.
The interface shall adapt gracefully to different viewport sizes.

5.2 Design Elements

The application shall use dynamic color gradients based on sentiment analysis.
Typography shall be clean and readable, with appropriate size hierarchy.
Interactive elements shall have clear hover and active states.
The application shall include subtle animations to enhance user experience without distraction.
Error states shall be visually distinct but not alarming to users.

6. Data Requirements
6.1 Quote Data

Each quote shall contain text content, author name, and a unique identifier.
Quotes shall be stored with their sentiment analysis results for efficient retrieval.
The system shall track when each quote was last displayed to the user.

6.2 User Data

The system shall store user favorites in browser localStorage.
The system shall store user preferences (e.g., theme preference) in localStorage.
No personal user data shall be collected or transmitted outside the browser.

7. Security Requirements

The application shall use HTTPS for all API communications.
The application shall validate and sanitize any user input.
The application shall not expose API keys or sensitive configuration in client-side code.
The application shall not store sensitive user information.

8. Future Enhancement Considerations
These items are not required for the initial version but should be considered in the architecture:

Support for multiple quote sources/APIs
User accounts for cross-device synchronization of favorites
Customizable visual themes beyond mood-based colors
Advanced filtering by quote category, length, or author
Integration with calendar applications for daily quote notifications
Offline mode with expanded quote collection

9. Development Phases
Phase 1: Core Functionality

Basic quote fetching and display
Initial sentiment analysis implementation
Simple color-based mood visualization

Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience

Favorites collection
Quote history
Improved visualizations and animations

Phase 3: Refinement and Optimization

Performance optimizations
Accessibility improvements
Additional filtering options

This specification provides a comprehensive framework for developing the Daily Quote Generator with Mood Analysis application, ensuring all key requirements are addressed while maintaining flexibility for creative implementation.
